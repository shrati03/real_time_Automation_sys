2) The goods receipt is taken via image upload and forwarded to the company's web page to account for the goods in the vehicle without any manual intervention. 
3) In a conveyer belt where the goods are being passed the numbers are counted using cv based models and matched with the ones in the reciept, then the final data is stored in db and the entire process gets automated.
